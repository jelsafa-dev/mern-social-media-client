# MERN Social Media

## Description

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

## Client-Side

The client-side of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for building reusable UI components and efficiently updating the UI when the underlying data changes.

The application's layout and navigation are handled using React Router, a library for handling client-side routing. This allows for a single-page app experience, where the entire application is loaded on the initial page load, and subsequent navigation is handled by updating the URL and rendering the appropriate components.

For the state management, the application uses the context API and useReducer hooks to manage the global state of the application, and for making API calls, the application uses the axios library.

The application also uses Material-UI, a popular React UI library, for styling the components and providing a consistent look and feel across the application.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you will need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in the root directory to install the necessary dependencies
3. Run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application
